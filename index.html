                    <h3><i class="fas fa-code icon"></i>OOBE Automation</h3>
                    <p>The Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) automation script, initially developed in Python, was designed to automate the initial setup process of computers for Innovative Computer Solutions. This script aimed to bypass the need for manual configuration during setup by utilizing a client-server model where a microcontroller communicated with a server running the automation script. The script employed computer vision techniques to detect and interact with UI elements, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, while functional, the original implementation faced challenges related to performance and scalability, particularly in environments with diverse hardware setups.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt icon"></i>Pirate Game AI</h3>
                    <p>The PirateGame AI project was originally developed as a reinforcement learning exercise where an agent was trained to navigate a maze and find treasure using the Q-learning algorithm. The goal was to create an AI that could learn and adapt to its environment, improving its decision-making process over time. The project was implemented in Python and served as a practical application of reinforcement learning techniques, demonstrating the agent's ability to learn optimal paths through trial and error. While effective, the original implementation had limitations in training efficiency and stability, particularly when dealing with complex maze configurations.</p>

                    <p>The carpool app was developed as a full-stack web application to replace a local school's walkie-talkie-driven carpool system with a more efficient, real-time digital solution. The application allowed teachers and students to stay in their classrooms while accurately tracking and managing which students needed to be sent to the carpool line. Built using modern web technologies such as Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, and WebSockets, the app showcased the ability to handle high-frequency data requests and provided real-time updates, significantly improving the school's carpool process. However, the initial implementation faced challenges with database performance and scalability, particularly under heavy load, which necessitated further optimization.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-code icon"></i>OOBE Automation</h3>
                    <p>The enhancement of the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) automation script involved converting the original Python-based solution into a standalone C++ application. This conversion was undertaken to improve the script's performance, scalability, and alignment with industry standards. The original Python script utilized a client-server model and relied on computer vision techniques to automate the initial setup of computers, reducing manual intervention. However, it faced challenges such as performance bottlenecks and limitations in scalability, particularly when deployed across diverse hardware environments.</p>
                    <p>During the enhancement process, several key improvements were made. The conversion to C++ not only boosted the execution speed but also allowed for more efficient memory management and reduced dependency overhead, making the solution more robust and scalable. The enhancement also included the integration of advanced features such as handling Windows scaling issues, ensuring DPI-awareness for accurate coordinate detection, and managing input simulation more precisely. Additionally, converting the machine learning model used for object detection from a Python-compatible format to one compatible with C++ (such as ONNX) ensured seamless integration and operation within the new environment. These enhancements significantly increased the script's reliability and effectiveness, making it a more powerful tool for automating the OOBE process.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt icon"></i>Pirate Game AI</h3>
                    <p>The enhancement of the PirateGame AI focused on upgrading the original Q-learning algorithm to Double Q-learning, significantly improving the training performance and stability of the AI agent. The original implementation involved an agent navigating a maze to find treasure using Q-learning, where the agent learned optimal paths through trial and error. However, this approach often suffered from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal decision-making in more complex environments. To address these issues, the enhancement introduced Double Q-learning, which maintains two separate value estimates to reduce this bias and provide more reliable learning outcomes.</p>
                    <p>The enhancement process involved deep modifications to the existing codebase, particularly in how the agent's learning process was handled. Implementing Double Q-learning required the development of dual Q-value tables, ensuring that action selection and value updates were correctly balanced between them. Additionally, efforts were made to optimize the code for better hardware performance, including configuring the training process to utilize GPU acceleration. These improvements not only made the AI more effective in navigating the maze but also provided a more stable and efficient learning environment, showcasing advanced algorithmic understanding and practical application of reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-database icon"></i>Carpool App</h3>
                    <p>The enhancement of the Carpool app focused on improving the performance and scalability of the application by addressing issues related to database efficiency and real-time data handling. The original implementation, built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, and WebSockets, replaced a local school's walkie-talkie-driven carpool system with a digital solution that allowed teachers and students to manage carpool logistics more efficiently. However, the app initially faced performance bottlenecks due to inefficient database queries, particularly under heavy load, which impacted its ability to handle high-frequency data requests smoothly.</p>
                    <p>To enhance the app, the primary focus was on optimizing the database layer and improving the overall architecture. This involved transitioning the main data handling from PostgreSQL to Redis for in-memory NoSQL data storage, which significantly reduced latency and improved the app’s ability to manage real-time updates. Additionally, the codebase was refactored from a monolithic design into a modular architecture, making it more maintainable and scalable. This refactoring allowed for better separation of concerns, easier troubleshooting, and future enhancements. These improvements not only resolved the initial performance issues but also positioned the app to handle higher user loads and more complex operations, demonstrating advanced software engineering practices and a strong understanding of database management.</p>
